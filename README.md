# Credit Risk Prediction

## Overview
By identifying key patterns and insights, the goal is to classify loan applicants based on their risk levels, which is essential for financial institutions to make informed lending decisions.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing distributions and correlations.
   - Analyzing feature importance.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating meaningful derived features.
   - Removing irrelevant or redundant variables.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Training multiple machine learning ensemble models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

5. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Using confusion matrices and other metrics to evaluate results.


## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Comprehensive analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques to enhance model performance by deriving new features.
- **Model Training:** Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
